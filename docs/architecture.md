# Contract System Architecture

## System Overview
The blockchain contract system is a sophisticated implementation that provides secure, versioned, and state-managed smart contract execution. The system is designed with emphasis on security, reliability, and maintainability.

### Core Components

1. Contract Registry
   - Maintains contract metadata and versions
   - Provides efficient contract lookup mechanisms
   - Handles contract deployment and existence verification
   - Manages version compatibility and upgrades

2. State Management System
   - Persistent state storage with snapshots
   - State migration and restoration capabilities
   - State diff tracking for version upgrades
   - State isolation between contracts
   - Size validation and boundary checks

3. Security Layer
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Version signature verification
   - Bytecode verification
   - Resource limits enforcement
   - Upgrade authorization checks

4. Version Control System
   - Semantic versioning support
   - Version compatibility checks
   - Rollback mechanisms
   - Version-specific execution paths
   - Upgrade validation

- Upgrade authorization requirements

### State Protection
- Isolation between contracts
- Size limits and validation
- Integrity verification
- Snapshot-based recovery
- Diff tracking for auditing

### Resource Management

- State size boundaries
- Operation concurrency controls
- Resource usage tracking
- Limit enforcement

### Upgrade Security
- Version signature verification

- State migration safety
- Rollback capabilities
- Access control preservation

## Error Handling Patterns

### Contract Operations
1. Deployment Errors
   - Invalid bytecode
   - Size limit violations
   - Resource allocation failures
   - Registry conflicts

2. Execution Errors
   - State access failures
   - Resource exhaustion
   - Version mismatches
   - Authorization failures

3. Upgrade Errors
   - Compatibility failures
   - State migration issues
   - Version conflicts
   - Authorization issues

### Recovery Procedures
1. State Recovery
   - Snapshot restoration
   - State rollback
   - Integrity verification
   - Consistency checks

2. Version Recovery
   - Rollback to previous version
   - State reversion
   - Access control restoration
   - Registry consistency check
