# Change Log: performance_test.rs

## [2024-01-24]

### Modified
- Added `mut` keyword to runtime variable after Arc unwrapping in test_state_integrity_under_load
  ```rust
  let mut runtime = Arc::try_unwrap(runtime).unwrap().into_inner();
  ```
  - This change was necessary to allow mutable operations on the runtime after unwrapping
  - Fixes compilation error related to mutable borrowing
  - Affects state recovery testing section

### Technical Details
- Location: blockchain/tests/performance_test.rs
- Function affected: test_state_integrity_under_load
- Impact: Enables mutable operations on runtime after Arc unwrapping
- No behavioral changes, only fixes compilation error

### Verification
- Compilation error resolved
- Test functionality remains unchanged
- State recovery testing works as intended
- Concurrent operation testing unaffected
