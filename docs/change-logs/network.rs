# Network Implementation Change Log

## [2024-01-08] - Network Synchronization Implementation
### Added
- Implemented efficient block broadcasting with validation
- Added block synchronization protocol
- Created network partition detection and recovery
- Implemented peer tracking and management
- Added comprehensive error handling

### Technical Details
#### New Structures
- NetworkError: Custom error type for network operations
- SyncMessage: Block synchronization message types
- PeerInfo: Peer tracking information
- SyncState: Synchronization state management

#### New Methods
- broadcast_block: Efficient block propagation with validation
- sync_blocks: Block synchronization protocol
- handle_network_partition: Partition detection and recovery
- validate_block: Block validation helper
- get_network_height: Network chain height detection
- request_blocks: Block request handling
- detect_partition: Network partition detection
- initiate_partition_recovery: Partition recovery protocol

### Performance Considerations
- Implemented batch processing for block requests (50 blocks per batch)
- Added peer scoring system for optimal peer selection
- Implemented efficient block validation before propagation
- Added periodic network health checks (30-second intervals)

### Testing
- Added unit tests for core functionality:
  - Network creation
  - Block broadcasting
  - Block synchronization
  - Partition detection

### Future Improvements
- Implement advanced gossip protocol optimizations
- Add more sophisticated peer scoring
- Enhance partition recovery mechanisms
- Add detailed network analytics
