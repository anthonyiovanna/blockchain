# Storage Implementation Change Log

## Initial Creation - [Current Date]

Added Storage implementation with the following features:

1. In-Memory Storage
   - Added simple in-memory storage implementation for testing
   - Implemented basic operations:
     * set: Store key-value pairs
     * get: Retrieve values by key
     * delete: Remove key-value pairs
   - Uses HashMap for efficient storage and retrieval

2. BlockchainDB Enhancements
   - Added CONTRACT_CF column family for contract storage
   - Updated column family list to include contract storage
   - Enhanced storage optimization to handle contract data
   - Updated storage statistics to include contract metrics

3. Error Handling
   - Implemented StorageError enum for comprehensive error handling
   - Added error conversion implementations:
     * From<rocksdb::Error>
     * From<Box<dyn Error>>
   - Enhanced error messages for better debugging

4. Testing
   - Added test suite for in-memory storage
   - Enhanced blockchain DB tests
   - Added contract storage tests

### Implementation Details:
- Used std::collections::HashMap for in-memory storage
- Implemented Result<T, StorageError> for all operations
- Added async support for blockchain operations
- Enhanced RocksDB configuration for better performance

### Technical Notes:
- In-memory storage is thread-safe
- All operations return Result for proper error handling
- Storage is optimized for contract operations
- Added proper cleanup in tests

### Next Steps:
1. Add persistence for in-memory storage
2. Implement caching layer
3. Add compression for contract storage
4. Enhance backup/restore capabilities
5. Add metrics collection
