# Change Log for api.rs

## [2024-01-09] Contract Deployment API Updates

### Fixed
- Fixed type mismatch in deploy_contract endpoint
- Updated contract address handling to use proper references
- Ensured compatibility with ContractRuntime interface changes

### Modified
- Changed contract address declaration to be mutable
- Updated deploy_contract to pass address by reference
- Maintained consistent error handling and response structure

### Technical Details
- Contract deployment now uses `&[u8; 32]` for address references
- Address generation placeholder remains in place for future implementation
- API response structure remains unchanged for backward compatibility

### Notes
- Address generation needs proper implementation in future updates
- Consider adding version upgrade endpoints in future iterations
