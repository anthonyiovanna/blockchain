# Change Log: contract/mod.rs

## [2024-01-09] Add Debug Implementation

### Added
- Added #[derive(Debug)] attribute to ContractRuntime struct to implement Debug trait
- This enables ContractRuntime to be used in Arc<RwLock<ContractRuntime>> which requires Debug

### Purpose
- Fixed compilation error in performance_test.rs where ContractRuntime needed to implement Debug trait
- All fields in ContractRuntime already implemented Debug, making it safe to derive

### Technical Details
- No functional changes to the code
- Only added derive attribute for Debug implementation
- This is a non-breaking change as it only adds a trait implementation
