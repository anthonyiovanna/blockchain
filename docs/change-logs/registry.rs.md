# Change Log: registry.rs

## [2024-01-24]

### Added
- Added `#[derive(Debug)]` to `ContractRegistry` struct to implement the Debug trait
  - This change was necessary to support Debug trait derivation for ContractRuntime struct
  - The Debug implementation is automatically generated for the struct and its fields
  - All internal collections (HashMap and BTreeMap) already implement Debug
  - No changes to functionality or behavior

### Technical Details
- Location: blockchain/src/contract/registry.rs
- Struct affected: ContractRegistry
- Dependencies: No new dependencies required
- Impact: Allows better debugging and error reporting for ContractRegistry instances

### Verification
- Compile-time verification that ContractRegistry implements Debug
- No runtime behavior changes
- Existing tests remain valid and unchanged
- All internal data structures (HashMap, BTreeMap) support Debug formatting
