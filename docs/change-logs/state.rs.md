# Change Log: state.rs

## [2024-01-24]

### Added
- Added `#[derive(Debug)]` to `StateManager` struct to implement the Debug trait
  - This change was necessary to support Debug trait derivation for ContractRuntime struct
  - The Debug implementation is automatically generated for the struct and its fields
  - All internal HashMaps already implement Debug
  - No changes to functionality or behavior

### Technical Details
- Location: blockchain/src/contract/state.rs
- Struct affected: StateManager
- Dependencies: No new dependencies required
- Impact: Allows better debugging and error reporting for StateManager instances

### Verification
- Compile-time verification that StateManager implements Debug
- No runtime behavior changes
- Existing tests remain valid and unchanged
- All internal data structures (HashMap) support Debug formatting
