# Change Log: access.rs

## [2024-01-24]

### Added
- Added `#[derive(Debug)]` to `AccessControl` struct to implement the Debug trait
  - This change was necessary to support Debug trait derivation for ContractRuntime struct
  - The Debug implementation is automatically generated for the struct and its fields
  - Both internal HashMaps (roles and role_admins) now support Debug formatting

### Technical Details
- Location: blockchain/src/contract/access.rs
- Struct affected: AccessControl
- Dependencies: No new dependencies required
- Impact: Allows better debugging and error reporting for AccessControl instances

### Verification
- Compile-time verification that AccessControl implements Debug
- No runtime behavior changes
- Existing tests remain valid and unchanged
