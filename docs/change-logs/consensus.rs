# Consensus Module Change Log

## [2024-01-08] - Major Update: Parallel Processing Implementation
### Added
- Implemented async support for ConsensusEngine trait
- Added parallel block validation capabilities
- Implemented parallel transaction verification
- Added efficient block proposal mechanism
- Created ConsensusError enum for better error handling
- Added new async methods:
  - create_block
  - process_new_block
  - validate_block (converted to async)

### Modified
- Updated ProofOfWork implementation with parallel processing
- Enhanced ProofOfStake implementation with parallel validation
- Improved test cases to support async operations
- Added batch processing for transaction verification
- Updated difficulty checking mechanism

### Technical Details
- Implemented parallel transaction verification using tokio channels
- Added batch processing with configurable chunk sizes
- Integrated futures::join_all for concurrent task handling
- Added proper error propagation throughout consensus operations
- Enhanced test coverage for async functionality

### Performance Improvements
- Transactions are now verified in parallel batches of 10
- Reduced block validation time through concurrent processing
- Improved memory efficiency with streaming verification
- Added configurable max_block_size for better resource management

### Dependencies Added
- async-trait
- tokio
- futures

### Future Considerations
- Implement sharding support
- Add cross-shard transaction handling
- Implement dynamic consensus parameters
- Add Byzantine fault tolerance
- Enhance network partition handling
