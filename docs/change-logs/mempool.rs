# Mempool Implementation Change Log

## [2024-01-08] - Parallel Transaction Processing Integration
### Added
- Implemented parallel transaction processing using batch verification
- Added transaction queuing system with VecDeque
- Added configurable batch size for transaction processing
- Added pending queue processing methods
- Added comprehensive test suite for parallel processing

### Technical Details
- Integrated Transaction::verify_batch for parallel signature verification
- Added memory-efficient batch processing with configurable size
- Implemented transaction prioritization through queue system
- Added proper error handling for verification failures
- Added new methods:
  - process_pending_queue(): Processes batches of pending transactions
  - process_all_pending(): Processes all pending transactions
  - pending_size(): Returns size of pending queue
  - with_batch_size(): Constructor with custom batch size

### Performance Optimizations
- Batch processing to reduce verification overhead
- Parallel verification of transaction signatures
- Efficient queue management for pending transactions
- Memory optimization through controlled batch sizes

### Testing
- Added new test cases for parallel processing
