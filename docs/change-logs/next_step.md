## Current Focus: Project Board Setup

1. Board Structure:
   - Create project board columns:
     * Triage
     * Backlog
     * In Progress
     * Under Review
     * Done
   - Define column purposes:
     * Triage: New issues awaiting initial review
     * Backlog: Validated issues ready for work
     * In Progress: Currently being addressed
     * Under Review: Changes pending review
     * Done: Completed and verified

2. Automation Rules:
   - Configure column triggers:
     * New issues → Triage
     * Assigned issues → In Progress
     * Pull requests → Under Review
     * Merged PRs → Done
   - Set up move triggers
   - Define auto-assignment rules
   - Configure notifications

3. Label System:
   - Priority labels:

     * P2: Medium
     * P3: Low
   - Status labels:
     * needs-triage
     * ready-for-dev
     * in-progress
     * needs-review
   - Type labels:
     * bug
     * enhancement
     * documentation
     * question
   - Area labels:
     * contract-system
     * registry
     * access-control
     * state-management
     * performance

4. Integration Setup:
