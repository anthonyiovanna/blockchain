# Contract Benchmarks Change Log

## Initial Creation - [Current Date]

Created comprehensive benchmark suite using Criterion.rs for performance measurement with the following benchmarks:

1. Contract Deployment Benchmarks
   - Measures single contract deployment performance
   - Uses black_box to prevent compiler optimizations
   - Provides baseline deployment metrics

2. State Operations Benchmarks
   - Grouped benchmarks for state operations:
     * State write performance
     * State read performance
     * State snapshot creation performance
   - Measures core state management operations
   - Uses in-memory storage for consistent results

3. Version Upgrade Benchmarks
   - Measures contract upgrade performance
   - Tests version management system efficiency
   - Provides metrics for upgrade operations

4. Concurrent Operations Benchmarks
   - Tests performance under concurrent load
   - Measures parallel deployment capabilities
   - Verifies system scalability

### Implementation Details:
- Used Criterion.rs for accurate benchmarking
- Implemented async runtime handling
- Added black_box optimization prevention
- Created reusable test contract generation
- Structured benchmarks in logical groups

### Technical Notes:
- Uses tokio runtime for async operations
- Implements in-memory storage for consistent testing
- Handles concurrent operations with tokio::spawn
- Uses Arc for thread-safe storage sharing

### Next Steps:
1. Add memory usage benchmarks
2. Implement network operation benchmarks
3. Add state migration benchmarks
4. Add large state handling benchmarks
5. Implement gas cost benchmarks
