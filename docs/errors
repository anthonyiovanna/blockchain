# Current Errors and Issues

## Contract Module (blockchain/src/contract/mod.rs)
1. Function::new usage in wasmer functions
   - Issue: Function signature and closure types are incorrect
   - Status: ✓ FIXED
   - Solution: Replaced with Function::new_native and proper type signatures

2. Method call argument count mismatch
   - Issue: Some methods are called with incorrect number of arguments
   - Status: ✓ FIXED
   - Solution: Added argument validation and type checking

3. Wasmer Import Error
   - Issue: Unresolved import `wasmer::NativeFunc`
   - Status: ✓ FIXED
   - Solution: Updated to use `wasmer::TypedFunction` and implemented proper function environment handling

## API Module (blockchain/src/api.rs)
1. ServiceRequest extensions
   - Issue: Extensions trait not properly imported/used
   - Status: ✓ FIXED
   - Files affected: api.rs

## Storage Module (blockchain/src/storage.rs)
1. Cache iterator issue
   - Issue: Cache type being used as iterator when it doesn't implement Iterator trait
   - Status: ✓ FIXED
   - Solution: Removed explicit Cache iterator usage

## Access Control Module (blockchain/src/contract/access.rs)
1. Role management
   - Issue: Role validation needs proper error handling
   - Status: ✓ FIXED
   - Solution: Added specific error types and improved validation

## Error Handling System (blockchain/src/contract/standards.rs)
1. Error type system
   - Issue: Need consistent error handling across modules
   - Status: ✓ FIXED
   - Solution: Added comprehensive error types and organized them into logical groups

## Type Safety Improvements
1. Type safety checks
   - Issue: Some type conversions need better safety checks
   - Status: ✓ FIXED
   - Solution: 
     - Added argument type validation in contract execution
     - Improved WASM type handling
     - Added proper error types for type mismatches

## Next Steps
1. Add more comprehensive tests for:
   - New error handling
   - Type validation
   - Role management
   - Contract execution

2. Update documentation to reflect:
   - New error types
   - Improved validation
   - Type safety requirements

3. Consider adding:
   - Error recovery strategies
   - More detailed error context
   - Performance monitoring

## Recently Fixed
1. ServiceRequest extensions in api.rs
2. Cache iterator issue in storage.rs
3. Function::new usage in contract/mod.rs
4. Method argument validation in contract/mod.rs
5. Role validation error handling in access.rs
6. Comprehensive error type system in standards.rs
7. Wasmer import and function environment handling in contract/mod.rs

## Notes
- All major issues have been resolved
- Focus should now be on testing and documentation
- Monitor for any new issues that arise during testing
