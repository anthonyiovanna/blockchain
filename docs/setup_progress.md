   - ✓ Implemented transaction handling and verification
   - ✓ Configured cryptographic primitives with ed25519-dalek
   - ✓ All 25 core test cases passing successfully
   - ✓ Successfully implemented RocksDB storage layer with column families for blocks, transactions, and UTXOs
   - ✓ Implemented robust transaction signing system with per-input signatures
   - ✓ Enhanced signature verification using ed25519-dalek's Verifier trait
