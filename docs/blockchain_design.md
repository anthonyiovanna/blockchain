# Blockchain Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the design of a high-performance, secure, and user-friendly blockchain implementation in Rust.

## Core Components

### 1. Block Structure
```rust
struct Block {
    header: BlockHeader,
    transactions: Vec<Transaction>,
    hash: Hash,
}

struct BlockHeader {
    version: u32,
    timestamp: u64,
    previous_hash: Hash,
    merkle_root: Hash,
    difficulty: u32,
    nonce: u64,
}
```

### 2. Transaction Structure
```rust
struct Transaction {
    hash: Hash,
    inputs: Vec<TransactionInput>,
    outputs: Vec<TransactionOutput>,
    timestamp: u64,
    nonce: u64,
}

struct TransactionInput {
    tx_hash: Hash,
    output_index: u32,
    signature: Option<Signature>,
}

struct TransactionOutput {
    amount: u64,
    recipient: Vec<u8>, // Public key of the recipient
}
```

### 3. Core Features

#### 3.1 Consensus Mechanism
- Implement a hybrid Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism
- PoW for initial distribution and network bootstrap
- Transition to PoS for better energy efficiency and scalability
- Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) for finality

#### 3.2 Network Layer
- P2P network using libp2p
- Efficient peer discovery and management
- Robust networking with NAT traversal
- Gossip protocol for transaction and block propagation

#### 3.3 Security Features
- Ed25519 for digital signatures
  - Secure transaction signing using ed25519-dalek
  - Separate signing and verification keys
  - Consistent signature verification across the system
- Blake3 for high-performance hashing
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy features
- Rate limiting and DOS protection
- Secure key management system

#### 3.4 Smart Contracts
- WebAssembly (Wasm) based smart contract platform
- Rust-native smart contract development
- Deterministic execution environment
- Gas metering and limitations

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Parallel transaction validation
- UTXO model with merkle trees
- Efficient state management using RocksDB
- Memory pool optimization
- Block propagation optimization using compact blocks

### 5. User Interface
- JSON-RPC API
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- CLI wallet interface
- SDK for developers

### 6. Scalability Solutions
- Sharding support for horizontal scaling
- Layer 2 solutions preparation
- State channels support
- Efficient pruning mechanism

## Data Flow

1. Transaction Creation and Signing
   - User creates transaction with inputs and outputs
   - Transaction is signed using Ed25519 keypair
   - Each input can be independently signed
   - Signatures are verified using public keys
   - Transaction is broadcast to network

2. Block Creation
   - Node collects transactions
   - Validates transactions and signatures
   - Creates merkle tree
   - Performs consensus mechanism
   - Creates new block

3. Block Propagation
   - New block is validated
   - Block is propagated to peers
   - Peers validate and add to their chain

## Security Considerations

1. Network Security
   - Peer authentication
   - Encrypted communication
   - DDoS protection
   - Eclipse attack prevention

2. Transaction Security
   - Double-spend prevention
   - Robust signature verification using ed25519-dalek
   - Per-input signature validation
   - Consistent transaction signing data
   - Input validation
   - Rate limiting

3. Consensus Security
   - Long-range attack prevention
   - Nothing at stake protection
   - Sybil attack resistance

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Metrics Collection
   - Network health
   - Transaction throughput
   - Block propagation times
   - Peer statistics

2. Upgrade Mechanism
   - Soft fork capability
   - Hard fork coordination
   - Version negotiation
   - Backward compatibility

## Future Considerations

1. Cross-chain Interoperability
   - Atomic swaps
   - Bridge protocols
   - Cross-chain messaging

2. Privacy Enhancements
   - Confidential transactions
   - Ring signatures
   - Stealth addresses

3. Governance System
   - On-chain governance
   - Proposal mechanism
   - Voting system
